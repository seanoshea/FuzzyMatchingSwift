Contributions to the development of the app are always welcome. Some guidelines:
- If you **found a bug**, _and can provide steps to reliably reproduce it_, open an issue.
- If you **have a feature request**, open an issue.
- If you **want to contribute**, submit a pull request.

See the [Issue Template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) for some helpful tips on what information is useful for getting a quick resolution to any issue you might want to open.

Github have published [How to write the perfect pull request](https://github.com/blog/1943-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request). While it's not necessary to follow each and every one of these ideas, it gives the reader some ideas of what constitutes a good pull request.

There's a simple well-intentioned [Code of Conduct](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/2/0/code_of_conduct.txt) for any community that might spring up around the development of the library too.
